> Probably not going to use any external libraries for Python-2.7 version of Processing
> Might use some libraries that can be downloaded from the Processing application
2. For JavaScript programs you can either use the online [P5.JS Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/ "p5.js Web Editor") or download the libraries from
